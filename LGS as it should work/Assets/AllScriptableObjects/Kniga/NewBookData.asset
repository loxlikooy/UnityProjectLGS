  - 'Section 1: Swamp with reeds, ponds, and rivers'
  - 'Section 2: Pleasant but very dangerous female creatures. According to Kazakh
    folklore, water nymphs or mermaids, often covered in mud, may inhabit the steppe
    rivers, channels among the reeds, and deep pools. Similar to sirens, they seduce
    young men with their songs and tickle them to death; they can come to yurts at
    midnight. The Kuldyrgysh kills a person by intense tickling, which is where the
    name comes from, meaning "the one who makes laugh."'
  - 'Section 3: No one knows for sure, as everyone who has seen it either went mad
    or died, but there is a belief that it is a one-eyed giant living in uninhabited
    mountains and caves. Those who survived an encounter describe it as a huge and
    fierce creature with incredible physical strength, capable of uprooting trees
    and destroying everything in its path. Despite its power, it is extremely foolish
    and naive, which can help in deceiving it and achieving victory.'
  - 'Section 4: When encountering Dyau, it is crucial to be extremely cautious and
    strategic. The giant emits a powerful wave of attack in all directions, so it
    is important to maintain distance and be ready to dodge. Dyau is slow, and this
    can be used to your advantage by maneuvering around him and striking at opportune
    moments. Since he is easily deceived, you can distract him with feints and quickly
    attack when he is most vulnerable.'
  - 'Section 5: Jeztyrnak is an evil demonic creature in the form of a beautiful
    young woman with incredibly long and terrifying copper claws, from which her
    name derives. She may appear as a reserved and silent beauty, but woe to anyone
    who meets her alone. Her piercing, unblinking cold gaze hypnotizes wanderers,
    and after they fall asleep, she drains all their blood, using her razor-sharp
    metallic claws.'
  - 'Section 6: The Certain Skull is an ancient and mysterious artifact shrouded
    in legends and myths. It is believed to have once belonged to a great warrior,
    commander, and ruler whose strength and power were so immense that even after
    his death, the skull retains powerful properties. This artifact appears as an
    old, rune-covered skull emitting a faint glow.'
  - 'Section 7: The Certain Skull is a very rare artifact and has been considered
    lost for many centuries. It was often guarded by powerful sentinels or hidden
    in ancient ruins filled with traps and puzzles. Legends say that only the bravest
    and most skilled hero can find and claim this artifact.'
  - 'Section 8: Health Increase: The bearer of the Certain Skull gains a significant
    increase in health, allowing them to withstand stronger attacks and stay in combat
    longer. This is especially useful in challenging battles where every unit of
    health counts.  Attack Power Enhancement: The Certain Skull also boosts attack
    power, making the wielder''s strikes more powerful and destructive. This provides
    an advantage in fights against strong opponents and enables quicker victories.'
  - 'Section 9: Samruk Egg  The Samruk Egg is an artifact symbolizing strength and
    renewal, imbued with ancient magic and light. Its elegant form resembles the
    bright radiance of the sun breaking through the veil of darkness and eternity,
    promising new opportunities and transformation for those who dare to approach
    its mysterious essence.'
  - 'Section 10: It is believed that within each Samruk Egg lies a fragment of ancient
    wisdom and vital force, capable of reviving the oldest dreams and ambitions.
    Its legendary power not only awakens spiritual perception but also grants the
    bearer unique abilities to overcome challenges and transform their path.'
  - 'Section 11: The Jeztyrnak Claw is an artifact imbued with sinister power and
    ancient magic. Forged from darkness itself, this claw has the remarkable ability
    to absorb the life force of its victims. Its curved shape resembles a menacing
    hook, and its copper surface reflects light, embodying its mysterious essence.'
  - 'Secrtion 12: Vampirism: Possessing the Jeztyrnak Claw grants the player a powerful
    vampiric ability. The bearer of this artifact can absorb the life force of their
    opponents, restoring their own health during battle. This not only gives the
    player an advantage in combat but also provides a strategic means of survival
    in the most dangerous situations.'
  - 'Section 13: The Wolf Fang is an ancient artifact endowed with mysterious power
    linked to mythological beliefs about wolves. It is believed that this artifact
    was created by wolf gods or spirits to protect its bearer from attacks by these
    wild predators.'
  - 'Section 14: Bond with the Pack: When the player picks up the Wolf Fang, they
    feel their connection with wolves strengthen, and the wolves no longer see them
    as a threat and cease to attack. This artifact becomes a reliable protector and
    a faithful companion for the player in their adventures through the wild expanses
    of the game world.'
  - 'Section 15: Koshkar is an exquisite piece of jewelry, forged from noble metal
    and encrusted with precious stones, beautifully combining elegance and power.
    Its strict lines and graceful form give it an appearance imbued with deep symbolism
    and ancient mystical associations.  The bearer of this jewel gains the ability
    to perform dashes over much greater distances than ever before'
  - 'Section 16: Powerful Dash: Koshkar''s ability allows the bearer to maneuver
    better on the battlefield, evade enemy attacks, and escape ambushes, making them
    more resilient and dangerous in combat. This artifact will be a faithful companion
    in your adventures, providing not only a stylish appearance but also a significant
    advantage in battle.'
